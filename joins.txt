It is used to get data from the multiple tables.
At least one common field must be there to create a join.

Types of joins:
   1.Inner join or equijoins
   2.Outer joins
   3.Natural join
   4.Cross join
   5.Self join
   
   
   Inner join:
   
   select employee_id,first_name,last_name,department.department_id from employee,department where employee.department_id=department.department_id;
   
   with alias name:
   select e.employee_id,e.first_name,e.last_name,d.department_id from employee e,department d where e.department_id=d.department_id;
   
   Outer join:
   
     Left outer join
	 Right outer join
	 Full outer join
	 
  Left outer join:
   
   It joins all the data from left side table and common data from right side table
   
   example:
   select e.employee_id,e.first_name,e.last_name,d.department_id from department d LEFT OUTER JOIN employee e  on e.department_id=d.department_id;
   select e.employee_id,e.first_name,e.last_name,d.department_id from employee e,department d where e.department_id=d.department_id(+);
   
  Right outer join:
  
   It joins all the data from Right side table and common data from left side table
   
    example:
  select e.employee_id,e.first_name,e.last_name,d.department_id from employee e RIGHT OUTER JOIN department d on e.department_id=d.department_id;
  select e.employee_id,e.first_name,e.last_name,d.department_id from employee e,department d where e.department_id(+)=d.department_id;
  
  Full outer join:
  
  Combination of left and right joins
  
  example:
  select e.employee_id,e.first_name,e.last_name,d.department_id from department d FULL OUTER JOIN employee e  on e.department_id=d.department_id;
  
  Natural join:
   performs inner join with less code
   No need to specify the columns
   
  Example:
  select employee_id,first_name,last_name,department_id from employee NATURAL JOIN department;
  
  Cross join:
  
  Every record in one table joins the every record in another table.
  
  Example:
  select employee_id,first_name from employee CROSS JOIN department;
  
  
  SELF JOIN:
   join a table itself
   Used when a record in a table related to another record in the same table
   
   EX: employee manager re
  
  
  Join with one or more tables:
  
  select e.employee_id,e.first_name,e.last_name,d.department_id,p.product_name
from employee e,department d,product p WHERE e.department_id=d.department_id 
AND e.department_id=d.department_id AND e.department_id=p.department_id;
