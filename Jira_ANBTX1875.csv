Not seeing it.

 

On Channel Utilization I see some things but am having trouble figuring out how I can get a summary by product.

 

Maybe someone could walk me through it from my PC?

 

 

Wanting to know channel usage for various checking products in aggregate by Channel (Banking Center, Online Banking, Debit Card and ATM).

 

 

For example, of our Business Checking customer HH, how many used a branch in the last 60 days?

How many times and what did they do each time?

 

Also would like to know what they did in online banking.

 

What was their RDC activity.

 

What was their other mobile activity?

 

What did they look at on our web site if anything?

 

 

 

Would be great if Analysis Activity could be added to sort for maybe some package priced solutions within treasury and maybe compared to various business industry segments.

Well there is not an easy way to treat differently in our systems.  Attached are a couple of pages out of the Loan import layout.
When we bring in the loan balances we decrement it for the participation sold amount.

So we need to either find a way to relate the cost of funds on the loan to the participations or reduce the loan balance to take out the participation.",,0|i006cr:,,,,,,,,,DS-11,,"{""hasEpicLinkFieldDependency"":false,""showField"":false,""nonEditableReason"":{""reason"":""EPIC_LINK_SHOULD_BE_USED"",""message"":""To set an epic as the parent, use the epic link instead""}}",Participation Loan Profitability,"{""accountId"":""5a6f88f96cd768507cc218e0"",""emailAddress"":""brianwaits@anbtx.com"",""avatarUrls"":{""48x48"":""https:\/\/avatar-cdn.atlassian.com\/5eb536b5b32b4fa20714497627790e7e?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F5eb536b5b32b4fa20714497627790e7e%3",brianwaits,0,{},,,,11/2/2018 0:00,0,,0

1.	Why are the number of active customers different on portfolio versus Tammy W.’s reporting?
2.	Are all the deposit accounts not in the portfolio dashboard?  Steve thinks it is missing some.
3.	Possibly some other questions Tammy and/or Susan had.
4.	Several beneficial ownership and other reports require Impromptu catalog update and they are waiting on us.   Not sure what this is about as I thought they told us they had solution for those reports.
5.	I think Tammy wants to know when she can use Tableau etc. it which is standard.   We need to do several things before we are ready for full self-service with Tableau and Informatica which include things like:  Training (custom class from Tableau being considered), se3omthign like the Enterprise 

We may have pull up meeting with Gail but if you can possibly reach out to them and get clarity then follow-up with a confirmation email (reiterating your understanding with them) on the conversation; that would help.

You may need to partner with David Arledge on this as well, especially given Naveen's vacation.

I prefer, longer-term, we get this dash boarded and possibly the data pulled periodically and warehoused as some of it will disappear after 7 days or a certain period of time.

Work on this. 

This effort will demonstrate how quickly your team can adjust and redirect (again...).

It appears there is a solution to this download tracking as described below.   

 

Do you want us to work on this and add it to our JIRA backlog or ?

 Subject: Fwd: Dashboard access

 


I don’t see any detail around data that was downloaded or saved to .pdf. I know I saved a copy of several dashboards to .pdf a few weeks ago. 

 

Is it possible to track and report on this activity?

There are many ways a customer can have fewer products with the bank: he/she can close an account, cancel a credit card, cancel an insurance product, etc. In this case, all products are considered to be equal and it is the number of products which is used to define churn.

Hey Jack,

 

I was asked yesterday by a teammate to pull a customer list of Architect users. NetTeller is moving to a new platform and they want to see which customers would be better off staying with Architect or better off in the new platform. They are looking to see how long Architect business customers have been in business, how many employees they have, total income, accounts and account balances.  Is there another way to pull data besides Impromptu? Like a Oracle or SQL Server? I am not very familiar with Impromptu. Do we have a Dashboard I could reference?

 

Thank you,

Tim,

I discussed it with Becky because I did not understand the issue.  Truthfully, the only thing you can do is “unallocated the allocated expenses from your total allocation I gave you.  As a visual, take the gross allocated out and adjust for each item you were allocated [to get to your income/expense prior to allocations] and then reallocate to the branches based on the original percentage.  

I truly do not understand taking those allocated expenses out of the equation because those are considered your expenses.

I think we have the data (in DIM Account) and just need a view possibly?  The Viz gives the execs at the top an idea of how big a deal it appears for the bank and then as officer, region, market filters applied the exact focus an officer needs to drill into for their portfolio.

The entire pp.12-27 is quite a bit to bite off.

I think the relationship declining one can be a quick hit but unsure where to put the viz and what it might look like exactly but pp.27 looks like a possibility with the hive over then identifying the customer?

Also, with regards to your new licenses, those products are on-prem licenses.  So rather than provisioning them to you Org, you should have received an email from our Shipping department with the license keys.  If for some reason you did not receive it, please let me know and I'll have it re-sent to you.

I know we have your plate pretty fully, but For May 2018 can we add to it with exploring the feasibility of  creating something like the following using the Tableau REST API or any other automated mechanism to remove users who are inactive after 60 days?

 
 Install Python Tableau Server Client REST API from GitHub onto jumpbox-dev then anb-staging then configure the API for our Tableau Server
Develop a connector and flow to remove users who have been inactive for 60 days including logging of actions taken in the application log

 

I think having this automation in place around June 2018 will enable us to keep our costs down on Tableau licenses.

 

 

Thanks,

 

Jack Haynes

1. Currently we have to perform most DBA functions and have limited bandwidth to perform these functions plus feel this should not belong to AppDev from a separation of duties concern plus heavy inter-dependence across multiple infrastructure components (shared storage, network performance, etc.) needs to always be considered win spinning up new databases, performing tuning, changing configurations etc.  I had thought from the previous DB consolidation project that Atrion was going to take up the DBA function as agreed to by Shane an Gail in mid to late 2017.

2.   We have had several recent events where we either ran short on disk space on servers and/or memory constraints which are not getting found which we thought were set-up to be monitored proactively by vendors.   Our ETL and Tableau efforts will be heavily dependent on having adequate storage and memory to have successful nightly and intra-day processing.  We need thresholds and actions taken when they are reached/alerted on.   Ideally it is recommended we stick with a single vendor for our infrastructure needs as the interdependencies between each service (DBA, monitoring etc.) are high making cross-vendor coordination unmanageable given our staff depth.  Specific incidents (where monitoring was missed) include:  C: drive filling up on anb-inform-dal and anb-tableau c drive filling up.   Memory also ran short on anb-inform-dal.
